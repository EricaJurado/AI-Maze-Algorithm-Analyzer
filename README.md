# AI-Maze-Algorithm-Analyzer

README

*******************************************************************************

AI Maze Algorithm Analyzer tests four different search algorithms to see which
can solve a randomly generated maze the fastest. 

Then it prints the times of each algorithm after 20 trails at 4 different 
difficulties to an MS Excel spreadsheet 

To run the program 

This program is in Python, if you don't have Python installed see 
https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download

1. Open Command Prompt or Terminal 

2. Navigate to the the folder with the program 

3. type:

4. Now check the folder again and you'll find the raw data from each test
and you'll also see a clean data file that has the averages and medians
for each test! 

Yay! You did it!
